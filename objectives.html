    <h1>Project Objectives</h1>
    <p>My main goal is to create an easy to navigate site showcasing all of the companyâ€™s surf boards in stock as well as other merchandise accessories like apparel, parts, and boat accessories. I also want to create a separate page within the website where customers can fill out certain criteria in regards to having a custom board built for them.  </p>
